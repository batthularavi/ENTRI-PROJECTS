              <h5 class="card-title">Thailand</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Thailand is where it all began for me so it holds a special place in my heart. It is where I decided to quit my job and travel the world. I lived there. I loved there. Thailand is incredible.

                It’s also super affordable.
                
                With a tourist trail going back decades, Thailand is the heart of backpacking in Southeast Asia, and you can get by on between $25-35 USD per day thanks to cheap guesthouses, budget street food (which can be found for as little as $1 USD!), local buses, and the many cheap and free attractions. If you spend all your time on the islands and inexpensive accommodation, expect to pay closer to $60 USD per day. However, even at the price, Thailand is still one of the most bargain-friendly destinations in the world and should not be skipped!.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title"> Central Americard title</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Want to roam ancient ruins, trek through the jungle, surf, and eat delicious food with few tourists around? Visit the smaller countries in Central America — think El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. Here you will find most budget hotels for around $15-30 USD per night, meals for under $5 USD, most bus journeys for the same price, and beer for as little as a dollar.

                Belize, Panama, Costa Rica — these are expensive destinations by regional standards (yet they are still quite affordable). If you visit these central Central American countries, you can get by on $40-50 USD per day as a backpacker or splash out $100 a day and live large. Your money goes really far in this part of the world. And with no many coun tries to choose from, it’s easy to bounce around and see a lot without going broke.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Cambodia</h5>
              <p class="card-text">While you could put all of Southeast Asia on this list, Cambodia is one of my favorite countries in the region — it’s affordable and beautiful, and the locals are incredibly hospitable. You can get a private, air-conditioned room for $25 USD, street food for $2-5 USD, and transportation across the entire country for $20-25 USD. If you are spending close to $50 USD per day, you are living large.

                Cambodia is cheaper than popular Thailand but just as beautiful and filled with some of the nicest people in the world. Plus, it’s home to the incredible Angkor Wat (which, while expensive to visit, is worth the expense!).</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">China</h5>
              <p class="card-text">China has fascinated travelers ever since Marco Polo traversed the Silk Road in 1275. While the days of China being a dirt-cheap destination are gone, the country remains a budget destination — and one of the cheapest in Asia — but with a caveat. You need to get out of the big cities. Sure, the cities are still a bargain. Hostels cost less than $20 USD, food is $2-5 USD per meal, and local transportation in cities runs less than a dollar.

                But, the country becomes even cheaper, when you get off the beaten path and the interior. This is where you’ll find the best travel deals and bargains! China still remains one of the best value places in the world and, with it’s massive size (it’s the 3rd largest country by landmass), there is a ton to see and do here!</p>

        <h5 class="card-title"> Mexico</h5>
        <p class="card-text"> While I’d been to Mexico before, it wasn’t until recently that I really spent a bunch of time there. And I was blown away. Mexico City is a foodie’s paradise, Oaxaca has copius amounts of charm (and a never-ending flow of mezcal to boot!), and the Yucatan is perfect for road trips and cenote exploring. And since it’s so close to the US, it’s not only cheap (beer is just $1-2 USD, groceries are around $25 USD per week, and you can get by on less than $50 USD per day here) but it’s cheap to get to — double win!

            While there are some regions that aren’t that safe to explore, the majority of the country is yours to enjoy. No matter your interests — beaches, partying, food, history, nature — there’s a corner of the country that you can enjoy safely without breaking the bank.
